Copy Update Method
Here's the approach I used that can be applied to the other guides:
1. Subtitle Update
Pattern: Replace generic target audience with credibility/authority statement
Before	After
"For Families Targeting [schools]"	"The Insider Playbook from Former UC Readers"
For other guides, use:
Private & Ivy: Emphasize Ivy alumni/admissions expertise
Essay System: Emphasize proven frameworks or success rate
2. Benefits List Update
Pattern: Replace vague claims with specific, concrete deliverables from the actual guide
Vague (Before)	Specific (After)
"Insider view of exactly how UCs evaluate..."	"How UC readers evaluate applications using the 14-factor Comprehensive Review"
"Grade-by-grade roadmap..."	"Grade 9-12 timeline with specific benchmarks for each year"
"Passion project strategies..."	"The Passion Project Formula to create a 'Spike' that stands out"
Key principles:
Use numbers (14-factor, 3 GPAs, Grade 9-12)
Name the frameworks (Passion Project Formula, Comprehensive Review)
Use terminology from the guide (builds trust that you'll get what's advertised)
Be outcome-focused (what the reader will learn/achieve)
